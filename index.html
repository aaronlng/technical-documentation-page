                C# is an object-oriented language, but C# further includes support for component-oriented programming.
                Contemporary software design increasingly relies on software components in the form of self-contained
                and self-describing packages of functionality. Key to such components is that they present a programming
                model with properties, methods, and events; they have attributes that provide declarative information
                about the component; and they incorporate their own documentation. C# provides language constructs to
                support directly these concepts, making C# a very natural language in which to create and use software
                components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several C# features aid in the construction of robust and durable applications: Garbage collection
                automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects; exception handling provides a
                structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery; and the type-safe design of the
                language makes it impossible to read from uninitialized variables, to index arrays beyond their bounds,
                or to perform unchecked type casts.
            </p>
            <p>
                C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit
                from a single root object type. Thus, all types share a set of common operations, and values of any type
                can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both
                user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic allocation of objects as well as in-line
                storage of lightweight structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure that C# programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner, much emphasis has
                been placed on versioning in C#'s design. Many programming languages pay little attention to this issue,
                and, as a result, programs written in those languages break more often than necessary when newer
                versions of dependent libraries are introduced. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by
                versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method
                overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

            <header id="hello_world">Hello World!</header>
            <p>
                The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        using System;

                        class Hello {
                            static void Main() {
                                Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                C# source files typically have the file extension .cs. Assuming that the "Hello, World" program is
                stored in the file hello.cs, the program might be compiled using the command line:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        csc hello.cs
                    </code>
                </pre>
                which produces an executable assembly named hello.exe. The output produced by this application when it
                is run is:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        Hello, World
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
