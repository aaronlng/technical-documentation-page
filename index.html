                    C# is an object-oriented language, but C# further includes support for component-oriented
                    programming.
                    Contemporary software design increasingly relies on software components in the form of
                    self-contained
                    and self-describing packages of functionality. Key to such components is that they present a
                    programming
                    model with properties, methods, and events; they have attributes that provide declarative
                    information
                    about the component; and they incorporate their own documentation. C# provides language constructs
                    to
                    support directly these concepts, making C# a very natural language in which to create and use
                    software
                    components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several C# features aid in the construction of robust and durable applications: Garbage collection
                    automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects; exception handling provides a
                    structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery; and the type-safe design of the
                    language makes it impossible to read from uninitialized variables, to index arrays beyond their
                    bounds,
                    or to perform unchecked type casts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double,
                    inherit
                    from a single root object type. Thus, all types share a set of common operations, and values of any
                    type
                    can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both
                    user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic allocation of objects as well as
                    in-line
                    storage of lightweight structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure that C# programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner, much emphasis
                    has
                    been placed on versioning in C#'s design. Many programming languages pay little attention to this
                    issue,
                    and, as a result, programs written in those languages break more often than necessary when newer
                    versions of dependent libraries are introduced. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced
                    by
                    versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method
                    overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

                <p>
                    The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in
                    C#:
                    <code>
                        using System;
                        class Hello {
                            static void Main() {
                                Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                    C# source files typically have the file extension .cs. Assuming that the "Hello, World" program is
                    stored in the file hello.cs, the program might be compiled using the command line:
                    <code>
                        csc hello.cs
                    </code>
                    which produces an executable assembly named hello.exe. The output produced by this application when
                    it
                    is run is:
                    <code>
                        Hello, World
                    </code>

                <p>
                    There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. Variables of value types
                    directly contain their data whereas variables of reference types store references to their data, the
                    latter being known as objects. With reference types, it is possible for two variables to reference
                    the same object and thus possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by
                    the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it is
                    not possible for operations on one to affect the other (except in the case of ref and out parameter
                    variables).
                </p>
                <p>
                    C#’s value types are further divided into simple types, enum types, struct types, and nullable value
                    types. C#’s reference types are further divided into class types, interface types, array types, and
                    delegate types.

                    The following provides an overview of C#’s type system.

                <p>
                    Expressions are constructed from operands and operators. The operators of an expression indicate
                    which operations to apply to the operands. Examples of operators include +, -, *, /, and new.
                    Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an expression contains multiple operators, the precedence of the operators controls the order
                    in which the individual operators are evaluated. For example, the expression x + y * z is evaluated
                    as x + (y * z) because the * operator has higher precedence than the + operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C# provides a number of operators to perform arithmetic, logical, bitwise and shift operations and
                    equality and order comparisons.

                <p>
                    An array is a data structure that contains a number of variables that are accessed through computed
                    indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the elements of the array, are all of the
                    same type, and this type is called the element type of the array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Array types are reference types, and the declaration of an array variable simply sets aside space
                    for a reference to an array instance. Actual array instances are created dynamically at runtime
                    using the new operator. The new operation specifies the length of the new array instance, which is
                    then fixed for the lifetime of the instance. The indices of the elements of an array range from 0 to
                    Length - 1. The new operator automatically initializes the elements of an array to their default
                    value, which, for example, is zero for all numeric types and null for all reference types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following example creates an array of int elements, initializes the array, and prints out the
                    contents of the array.
                    <code>
                            using System;
                            class ArrayExample
                            {
                                static void Main() 
                                {
                                    int[] a = new int[10];
                                    for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) 
                                    {
                                        a[i] = i * i;
                                    }
                                    for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) 
                                    {
                                        Console.WriteLine($"a[{i}] = {a[i]}");
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This example creates and operates on a single-dimensional array. C# also supports multi-dimensional
                    arrays. The number of dimensions of an array type, also known as the rank of the array type, is one
                    plus the number of commas written between the square brackets of the array type. The following
                    example allocates a single-dimensional, a two-dimensional, and a three-dimensional array,
                    respectively.
                    <code>
                            int[] a1 = new int[10];
                            int[,] a2 = new int[10, 5];
                            int[,,] a3 = new int[10, 5, 2];
                    </code>
                    The a1 array contains 10 elements, the a2 array contains 50 (10 × 5) elements, and the a3 array
                    contains 100 (10 × 5 × 2) elements. The element type of an array can be any type, including an array
                    type. An array with elements of an array type is sometimes called a jagged array because the lengths
                    of the element arrays do not all have to be the same. The following example allocates an array of
                    arrays of int:
                    <code>
                            int[][] a = new int[3][];
                            a[0] = new int[10];
                            a[1] = new int[5];
                            a[2] = new int[20];
                    </code>
                    The first line creates an array with three elements, each of type int[] and each with an initial
                    value of null. The subsequent lines then initialize the three elements with references to individual
                    array instances of varying lengths.
